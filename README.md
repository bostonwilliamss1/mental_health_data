# Overview

I am analyzing a data set about mental health and the difference aspects that go into how people feel. The data set includes the persons age, gender, occupation, days they have spent indoors, if they have growing stress, if they have quarantine frustration, if their habits have changed, if their family has a history of mental health illness, weight gain/loss, mood swings, coping struggles, if they have lost interest in their work, or if they feel as if they have socail weakness.

I picked two questions that I get answered by this data set. One is 'Is there a correlation between the amount of days people stay indoors to growing stress levels?' The other one is 'Is there a significant difference in reported frustration during the first two weeks of quarantine (Quarantine_Frustration) between different age groups or occupations?' I picked this question because I was curious if people who typically had jobs that dealt with people often and were outside the house, would have more struggles dealing with the first 2 weeks of quarantine.

# Data Analysis Results
Is there a correlation between the amount of days people stay indoors to growing stress levels?

Looking at those results from the percentages of people and the different amount of times they stayed outdoors, it does not look like there is a correlation to growing stress and the amount of days that people stay inside. I would have thought that there would have been due to the need people have to be social. I would have expected to see that it would have been most people who said they had higher stress levels to be in their house the longest (longer than 2 months) but rather the majority is people who have been in their houses 1-14 days.

Is there a significant difference in reported frustration during the first two weeks of quarantine (Quarantine_Frustration) between different age groups or occupations?

Occupations: 
Looking at the data from the graphs and the different percentages, it is interesting to note that Housewives take up a quarter of all of the people who said yes to having frustrations with quarantine. I would have thought that they would have been the least because they are used to staying home. I also think it is interesting that students were so low. I know when I was a student in quarantine, it was very hard because I was so used to being social with all of my friends and classes. But maybe the students in this study were able to relax from the stress of school. It is also important to note that this is the frustration in the first two weeks. So this is the initial reaction to getting a few weeks off. The people in the study did not know how long it was going to last.

Ages:
Based on the percentages of the different ages, the group who had the hardest time with the first two weeks of quarantine were the 16-20 year olds. That is accurate to what I thought it would be because these teenagers/young adults are used to going out and being very social so when they are not able to do that, I could imagine that could be very hard. But the group who had the lowest percentage was the 20-25 year olds. This is surprising because I would have thought that they would have been second to the youngest group. The 25-30 year old group and 30 and above group are pretty similar in percentages, which is not surprising to me. This isn't the best data set because it is not very specific. I could come to a better conclusion if there were more sections

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop the software. 

I used Python as the programming language and I used Pandas to assist with the data analysis. To make the graph I also had to download matplotlib.pyplot.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* If I had more time I would answer some more questions. I feel like you could learn so much more.
* I would improve the formatting in the terminal, or I would have created a place outside the terminal to show the results.
